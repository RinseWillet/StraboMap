# StraboMap
Experiment for spatial visualization of ancient texts - Strabo 

This program uses Leaflet to map the places, tribes, cities, forests and other features mentioned by Strabo for the North-Western European continent. The locations are based off the Pleiades website / Barrington Atlas initially, but will be updated as my study progresses. Papa Parse is used to read out the csv file with the data and in combination with JQuery. The data management is to be replaced by a full server / database functionality.

To do:

- add other layers of data and make them selectable
- design the basemaps in mapbox
- create a server side
- make a list functionality
- make a search option
